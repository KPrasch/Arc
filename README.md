# Arc

**Arc** is an experimental, privacy-preserving, permissionless, decentralized location-sharing application. Arc enables secure, end-to-end encrypted location sharing with fine-grained, on-chain access control, making it a powerful tool for individuals or groups needing private, censorship-resistant communication and location sharing.

## Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**  
  Messages are encrypted using a public key generated by a Distributed Key Generation (DKG) protocol, ensuring that only authorized recipients can decrypt the data.

- **On-Chain Access Control**  
  Users can set on-chain conditions for access, such as:
  - Specific block time for access windows
  - Minimum token balance requirements
  - NFT ownership verification

  These conditions control who can decrypt and access the location data, creating a customizable privacy layer.

- **Decentralized, Censorship-Resistant Messaging**  
  Arc uses the [Waku network](https://waku.org/) for peer-to-peer message delivery, enabling secure and private data sharing without reliance on centralized servers. Waku’s decentralized framework ensures censorship resistance by allowing messages to propagate across nodes without a central authority, making it difficult for any single entity to restrict communication.

- **Threshold Network’s [TACO](https://threshold.network/) (Threshold Access Control)**  
  Arc integrates TACO for end-to-end encryption and access control, enabling users to encrypt location data and control access permissions directly on-chain. By operating on a decentralized network, TACO enhances censorship resistance, preventing any authority from blocking or tampering with data access.

## Technical Overview

Arc combines a range of decentralized technologies to provide a secure, censorship-resistant communication system:

- **Waku Network**  
  Arc utilizes [Waku](https://waku.org/) nodes for peer-to-peer message delivery, providing a resilient and censorship-resistant network for real-time location sharing.

- **Threshold Network’s TACO**  
  Through [TACO](https://threshold.network/), Arc provides a secure and censorship-resistant method for encryption and access control, allowing users to define their own privacy parameters directly on-chain.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- [Waku Network](https://waku.org/) node setup for P2P message routing
- [Threshold Network](https://threshold.network/) integration for encryption and access control
- Arc account and wallet configured for creating and managing on-chain access policies
